## About me

<!---<img align="left" src="/images/me.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --->
I am a highly skilled and experienced tech lead in the field of surgical robotics. I bring a wealth of experience in both robot control and software development to the table. With a proven track record of successful projects, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to drive technical innovation and deliver results.

Throughout my career, I have been instrumental in the design and implementation of cutting-edge surgical robots, leveraging my expertise in control algorithms, software architecture, and real-time systems. I have a deep understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in developing robotic systems for use in the operating room, and I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to improve these systems and make them more user-friendly and effective.

I am excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to improve our lives.

In past lives, I…

* Designed, implemented and tested robot control software for the Stryker´s  first robotic-assisted device for spine surgery [MAKO Robotics](https://www.stryker.com/us/en/joint-replacement/systems/Mako_SmartRobotics_Overview.html) and contributed to the market launch fo the first spinal robotics system of Stryker.
* Led advanced numerical IK solver development for multi-arm surgical robot system at [KUKA R&D Medical Robotics](https://www.kuka.com/en-de/industries/health-care/kuka-medical-robotics/sunrise_os-med).
* Improved robot motion planning algorithms of high-payload and redundant kinematics used for radiation therapy applications at KUKA R&D Medical Robotics.
* Developed force and impedance control based on Nullspace optimization for manipulation tasks at [KUKA Corporate Research](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/future-production/innovation-and-research) in Germany. 
* Did my Master's thesis in Robotics Engineering supervised by [Prof. Bruno Siciliano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R1eV0ekAAAAJ&hl=it) (University of Naples) in collaboration with KUKA Corporate Research in Germany with a focus on torque-based control algorithms and Nullspace redundancy optimization.

I am currently designing the next generation of [Philips´s](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/e/image-guided-therapy/vascular-care) robotic-assisted endovascular procedures, overseeing the software architecture of the robotic control subsystem in Cambridge MA.
