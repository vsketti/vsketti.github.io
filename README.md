## About me

![!](/me.png)

I am a highly skilled and experienced tech lead in the field of surgical robotics. I bring a wealth of experience in both robot control and software development to the table. With a proven track record of successful projects, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to drive technical innovation and deliver results.

Throughout my career, I have been instrumental in the design and implementation of cutting-edge surgical robots, leveraging my expertise in control algorithms, software architecture, and real-time systems. I have a deep understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in developing robotic systems for use in the operating room, and I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to improve these systems and make them more user-friendly and effective.

I am excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to improve our lives.

In past lives, I…

* led advanced numerical IK solver development for multi-arm surgical robot system at [KUKA R&D Medical Robotics](https://www.kuka.com/en-de/industries/health-care/kuka-medical-robotics/sunrise_os-med).
* developed force and impedance control behaviors for manipulation tasks at [KUKA Corporate Research](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/future-production/innovation-and-research) in Germany. 
* did my Master thesis in Robotics Engineering supervised by [Prof. Bruno Siciliano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R1eV0ekAAAAJ&hl=it) (Univiersity of Naples) in collaboration with KUKA Corporate Research in Germany.

I am currently designing the next generation of [Stryker´s](https://neurosurgical.stryker.com/advanced-guidance-technologies/) robotic-assisted surgical procedures for spine and cranial surgeries.
